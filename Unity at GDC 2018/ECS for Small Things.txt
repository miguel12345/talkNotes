ECS

Performance by default
Scalability by default

Data oriented design


Unity for small things, small footprint


ECS

Entities
	set of components

Components
	Data holders

Systems
	Operate on data in components



The game loop is just a bunch of systems

Asset Loading
Player input
...
Rendering


Each system does one, extremely simple thing and they can be easily parallelized


ECS bullet example

Bullet -> resource entity

Bullet prototype (instance of a bullet?)

Bullet systems
- Shooting
- Collision
- Damage
- Cleanup
- Audio
- Rendering


Components can be created directly inside the editor

basically the point is to support a embedded runtime that can be used in a variety of contexts
