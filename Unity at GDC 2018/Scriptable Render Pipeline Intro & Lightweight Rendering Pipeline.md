SRP is a way to configure rendering from C#

![](render_pipeline.png)

HDSRP and LWSRP

LWSRP -> single pass forward rendering
no point light realtime shadows
no realtime GI
no Light cookies


render pipelines are configured through a scriptable object

scriptable rendering pipelines offer a way to hook into unityÂ´s internal rendering pipeline. not fully costumizable though

Standard shader is comptabile to the built-in RP but not with the new SRP

using the new render pipeline reduces the number of batches significantly


High deginition render pipeline


Shader Model 5 and up
