Once again, performance by default

Game objects and components are laid out randomly in memory

ECS and the job system are all about data layout

Components of performance

Data layout
Multi-core
Burst

C# jobs use a subset of high-performance C#

Instantiation is now basically free with ECS


The importance of a sandbox
	Simple & safe, with good feedback for errors
	this principle applies to multi threading
	by avoiding race conditions

Unification (one way of writing code)
Unify engine and game code
Scalable runtime


Iteration time is super important
Determinism is built as a core principle
